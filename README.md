## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

A basic installation of python 3 and scikit learn along with pandas and seaborn will easily setup the environment for running this notebook.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

By using this dataset, I wish to explore what impacts the 'Black Friday' sales. Black Friday is the official kick off to the holiday season. It is one of the most important time for a retailer or a wholesaler and thus it is important to understand what impacts the user buying behaviour. By using the insights, how can a business improve their throughput is what I wish to explain from this Blog Post.

I will try to answer the following questions:

Question 1: A quick analysis of most spending users to find out who has the highest CLV?

Question 2: How is the distribution of users across age and gender?

Question 3: Which products garner the maximum sales during black friday?

Question 4: How are the users spread across cities and occupation?

Question 5: Correlation between Gender, Age, Occupation, City_Category, Stay_In_Current_City_Years, Marital_Status, Product_Category_x vs Purchase

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
